					<h2>Who is Rene?</h2>
					<p>Music lover, anime watcher, guitarist, PC gamer, chess player, movier goer, wannabe singer, internet surfer and binge eater— Yep! Those are some of the characteristics of one Rene Yao Aldea. The keyword here folks is the word, “some” though, because there are a lot more to know about yours truly that this web page will never be able to accommodate.</p>	

					<p>Born from the infusion of cells of my great Father and Mother, I was born on the 22nd of the month when trees and flowers are in the growing season and begin to open (Yeah, I know, Wikipedia thing right?), simply April of 1992. This means that I am about the age of... wait, you do the math: from 1992 until today, I am <span class="badge show-age" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Click me!!!">???</span> years old.</p>
					
					<p>I consider myself to be friendly(...although doesn't look like it at first impression), talkative(...silent at first; I'm like a diesel engine, I need to heat up first before going vroom, vroom), patient, moody at times and pseudo-perfectionist. And by the way, I'm really approachable, just don't catch me having my headphones on because I may not be able to notice you talking to me. I like to check out fun and interesting things too. Recently I've been watching stand-up comedy perforemd by Gabriel Iglesias and Russell Peters (Yeah, that's plugging in folks!) in which I just stumbled upon in Youtube this 2016. Show me books with titles about history, trivias or what was it like on Primeval Earth, I'm sure I'm gonna read that. Maybe in the end I just like to discover many things and have a fun along the way.</p><hr>
					
					<h2 class="web-head">Rene as a Web designer &amp; developer?</h2>
					<p>My inspiration for being a Web designer and developer didn't come as early to me as you may think. It's not something that I've dreamed of to become since a young age but I can confidently say that the motivation to become one came to me naturally. For me to finish a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I've encountered and studied several subjects with regards to programming. With Java and C++ being the first programming languages I learned in college, I've been able to create simple to subcomplex programs using them. The coding process and results gave me a feeling of satisfaction, interest and enjoyment.</p> 
					
					<p>Sooner and later, I had undertaken a course entitled "System Analysis Design" where topics such as the Agile Method and Waterfall Model of sorts are discussed, it is also the course where I was taught of creating Web pages and applications using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and PHP. In this course, we had a project to create a business Web site for a client of our choice. Finishing and presenting the project to the client along within a team as a group project, that was the first time I've created a Web site in the sense of professional and business standard. Since then, I have aspired to become a Web designer and developer.</p>
					
					<p>Well saying all that, there were technologies that I studied by myself to be able to reach up to this point. As being a designer is very different from being a developer, I have engaged myself to learn such applications like Adobe Photoshop in order to elevate myself to become a decent Web designer. And these things are fun too. Being able to create such simple layouts and other graphic arts like logos and the like is very interesting to do (Heck, I've even started to practice drawing manga and even though I'm not right now, I'm still desiring to draw; well seems unrelated but what I mean is that art &amp; graphics thingy is an interest of mine too).</p>	

					<p>And now, I welcome you to my handmade personal website (...where blood, sweat and tears were not wasted). It is the medium where I can display my passion and knowledge for Web designing and development. At the same time, this is where I can express a part of who I am to the World Wide Web. As both designer and developer, I want to show that what I’m pursuing now is a passion in which I want to grow in professionally.</p>		

					<p>To finally end this litany of words, I would just like to declare that I am still a young Web designer and developer who is always continuing his self-study to improve oneself in this profession that he chose as a MAN! To GOD be all the glory.</p>

You can visit the site where a demo version of the web application is hosted by clicking on the header title above. For a teacher account, you can use <kbd>USERNAME: visitor</kbd> and <kbd>PASSWORD: password</kbd>. For a demo student account, <kbd>USERNAME: student_demo</kbd> and <kbd>PASSWORD: password</kbd>. You can test all the available functions of the demo web app. Play and experiment with it. For any kind of questions, comments or suggestions, check my contacts above and send me a text, chat or e-mail.</h5>
